										<h1>Additional Example</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Thor_Image.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Summary:  The still image is a L’Oreal advertisement that uses a familiar face that is seen in the blockbuster hit, “The Avenger.”  The familiar face, in reference to the movie, is associated with masculinity whereas L’Oreal is associated more with the female demographic.
 <br><br>
Analysis: The L’Oreal brand is a well known brand that is drawing on the consumer’s knowledge of the brand.  L’Oreal drops the first letter, “L”, in the advertisement and replaces the letter with, “Th.”  By not utilizing the full name of the brand, the company risk confusing the consumer.  Out of curiosity, I googled the word, “Thoreal,” and I was mildly surprised that a L’Oreal website wasn’t front and center.  Instead, I had to click on other links that referenced L’Oreal before I made it to the L’Oreal website.  The L’Oreal brand might be well known, but for those people who don’t know L’Oreal, the advertisement might confuse them: younger generations, older generations who don’t watch or know about the Avengers.
                  Putting aside people who don’t know about the Avengers or L’Oreal, the ad is fairly effective.  It is clear that L’Oreal is reaching out to a new consumer base, men.  The ad is appealing to guys since the ad shows a man perceived as masculine by females and males.  This ad might be appealing to guys who want their hair to be flowing and smooth but who have been afraid to purchase products that would provide the smooth and flowing hair since those types of products are more associated with females and not males; thus the ad gives the average male confidence when purchasing a L’Oreal product (assuming there was hesitation prior to ad).  The secondary audience are people who already use the product.  The ad not only reminds the average user to continue to use the product, but it is also showing that the product is growing in recognition and that celebrities are using L’Oreal; which is to say, you should continue to use the product so you can feel like you are one-step closer to living the life of a celebrity.
               <br>   Linguistically, the name of the advertisement is simple and easy to remember.  The letters contrast the blond hair in the back making the letters pop out in a way that doesn’t take away from the highlights of the blond hair.  The alignment of the letters is not front and center, but are in the left hand corner. <br> Visually the placement of the word is good for two reasons.  First, the letters do not cover up the visual of the ad, since after all, the purpose of the product is to show off one’s luscious hair; after all, if the name covered the hair, the visual display would be lost and there would be less of a motivation for the consumer to purchase the product.  Second, most people read from left to right starting at the top left of the page (the exceptions are books like the Japanese animated books).  By placing the word in the top left, the eyes will automatically, and comfortably, move where they already go, the top left of the ad.
                  The gestural mode the model/actor is serious.  He isn’t posing like the typical L’Oreal model, which is usually in an alluring way.  Instead, “Thor” is posing in a rugged way where his eyebrows are furrowed and there is a look of intensity and purpose.  Again, this pose pulls away from the stereotypical female pose so as to draw in a new demographic of cliental.<br>
                  The simplicity of the ad allows easy visualization and purpose.  It’s difficult to not understand what the ad is portraying (unless, again, if you are unfamiliar with the blockbuster hit or the hair-cleaner company).  Even if you are unfamiliar with the brand, a google search and investigation will enable to help you understand who is really selling the product, L’Oreal.  The purpose of the ad is pretty straight-forward, this product name will provide your hair with a smooth and glowing look and yes, it is for men. 
<br><br>
As you can see, I not only referenced three of the five modes (gestural, visual, linguistic), I included background information and an analysis of different ways in which this ad is and is not effective.  I also provided primary and secondary audiences for whom the ad is directed.  I give a lot of information and then an explanation of that information.  It is not enough to say how the ad exhibit certain modes of communication, but why the mode is important and how that mode is reaching certain audience members; and that is what I have here.
