									<p>Peer’s Comment:

Summary: This is an ad for Foundation for Animals in the Law, designed to try animal abusers in the court of law and lobby for my laws preventing animal abuse. The ad shows a cat wearing the traditional judge wig that is commonly used to portray a judge. 
Analysis: I really like this ad and think it's cute, humorous, and makes a big impact. Visually, it shows a pretty adorable cat wearing a judge wig, which is funny but also shows you the subject the ad sets out to cover. Linguistically, the ad says "People who abuse animals deserve a tough judge." This statement definitely is hard-hitting while also being humorous. Because, you read the statement, and you think "right, people who abuse animals DO deserve a tough judge", but then again it's also kind of "punny" (i.e. a funny pun) in that the cat is the judge. I believe this fact makes it a very effective ad. The only thing I'd change is the text in the bottom to be a little bigger to explain what the organization does. 
<br>
My Response:


 It is interesting that the font used describe that animal abusers need to have tough judges is in a not so tough font.  In part, the overall effect of the ad doesn't ring a serious tone, but instead seems almost comical.  The ad might grab a person's attention, especially someone who really likes cats, but the ad doesn't scream authority and seriousness, thus diminishing the overall intention, to gain people's trust so as to acquire donations.  If a person doesn't believe that the organization is serious, then a person is less inclined to donate some of their earned income.
I do appreciate the use of a paper clip in the bottom right hand corner.  Paper clips are sometimes associated with groups of paper that might be passed around in a law office.  The use of a paper clip suggests that there is more behind the initial ad, maybe legal information.  The paper clip also suggests business and a sense of formality.
Of all the animals that could have been used, it is interesting and appropriate that a cat is used here.  Cats are associated with being judgmental and having a serious look on their face, similar to that of a judge. A person has to work to gain the trust of a cat, similar to a court proceeding where the defense and plaintiff have to work to persuade the judge in their favor.  A dog would not have been as effective here, nor would most any other animals.
Overall, the ad is fairly effective in that it grabs the attention of people who really like animals, but more could be done to relay the seriousness of the situation and the professionalism of the organization.

									<p>As is clear in my response, I provided a different analysis than the original post.  Hopefully the response will provide, to the original poster and other viewers, a different way of viewing the advertisement. (Design Journal 12).
<br><br>
Again, even though I may not have contributed a great deal verbally in class, what I did provide has great quality and I believe I should be graded on my quality and not quantity.  I take the same amount of time, if not more, to thoroughly think and write out my detailed responses which brings a different perspective.
<br><br>
Additionally, I was in class most every day, with two exceptions were I was ill and stayed home, but I followed the slide shows that Professor Gardner had online.  On days where we were only working on Major Projects or right before a big break, I was in class.  If I was going to miss a day, just for fun, I would have skipped these days, but I didn’t.  I was in class which speaks to my overall thoughts on the class: I enjoyed and wanted to be in class.
