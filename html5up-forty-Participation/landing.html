								<p>Professor Traci Gardner’s Writing and Digital Media class offered at Virginia Tech is a course that is challenging and time consuming, but you come out of the class feeling like you accomplished something that is applicable in the market place.  Students learn how to create a website with connecting web pages.  As if learning and creating an html website isn’t hard enough, Professor Gardner forces/encourages the students to critique and partake in weekly discussions that analyzes different modes of advertisement.  While critiquing ads is a fun and beneficial challenge, another benefit of posting these critiques in a group discussion format is the way that the group forum fosters discussions and allows users who don’t (are nervous to) speak in class to voice their opinions/suggestions.  My participation in the discussion forum, small groups, and weekly design journals are proof that I deserve an “A” in Professor Gardner’s class.

										<h2>Small Group Discussion:</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Professor Gardner advised that by the end of the semester, we should have at least 10 specific instances in which we contributed valuable advice in our small group discussion.  I have 12 documented comments in which my peers remarked that my suggestions were valuable to them as they assembled their major project.  In an effort to save space here, I will only include five very specific examples, here.  I am happy to include all twelve if needed.
									<br><br><li>
Discussed Major Project with Morgan on December 7th, 2016: &nbsp &nbspSuggested and
showed her how to change the sound quality in Audacity
so the music will be louder in the beginning before she
speaks and then the music gets softer when she starts to
 speak.  Hopefully this will add more to her over all project.

<br><br><li>Discussed Major Project with Amanda on November 28th, 2016: &nbsp&nbspSuggested that she
add a budget information form that lets viewers know how
much the items cost and how viewers should best budget for
 the desserts they want to make.  This might encourage
(or maybe discourage) viewers to make the dessert.  If
anything the viewer will be more prepared when they go
to the store to purchase the needed items.


<br><br><li>Discussed Major Project with Amanda November 16th, 2016: &nbsp &nbspSuggested
that she should place a bright light over her baked items.
 Her photos seem to be in a shadow and by adjusting
the light, she could make the item displayed much
clearer which could really brighten up the overall appeal
of the website.

<br><br><li>Discussed major project with Amanda on November 9th, 2016: &nbsp &nbsp Suggested for
her project, since she is baking, maybe she finds video
of a professional who is making the same thing and
 then swap back and forward between the professional
and herself, especially if the baking that she does turns
out poorly.  The changing back and forth might bring more
humor to the project and help overall.


<br><br><li>Discussed major project with Morgan on November 9th, 2016: &nbsp &nbsp Suggested that
she includes how she came to discover the band she is
talking about.  By adding this little bit of information,
the website becomes more personal and relatable for the
viewer.  The addition might bring more substance to
 the project overall.

 <br><br>As you can see, I have actively participated in the small group discussions and I give thoughtful feedback.  I have exceeded the suggested 10 examples and I’ve provided helpful suggestions that have hopefully helped Amanda and Morgan as they’ve worked on their Major Projects.

											<p>Journal 1 Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9lYt6GcAxc" target="_blank">Doritos Goad Ad; 2013 Super Bowl Commercial Features Funny Man-Pet Relationship</a><br><br>Specifically, in design journal 1, I remarked on the gestural mode of the characters and how one character was closed off and afraid whereas another was open and welcoming.  Throughout the commercial, the opened character at first became afraid and closed off.  The discussion hopefully helped the class as a whole to understand the use of gestural mode and the overall understanding of the mode's impact on our viewing of a video.<br><br>	Journal 3 Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg1CMuBumOU" target="_blank"> Tina Fey’s Guide to Workout Gear: American Express</a>	<br><br>In the third design journal, specifically, I remarked on the primary audience of the intended video.  The discussion could have brought more clarity to the class on how to evaluate who the primary audience of an ad might be.</p>
